        This is a simple app to load all the stock tickers from Rev.\n
        Clicking on the "Start Service" button will first navigate you to settings. You need to activate this app\'s AccessibilityService.
        Next clicking the "Start Service" button will show a notification, then you need to navigate to Rev to the list of stocks.\n
        At that point you should click Start Loading. Now the it will start to sync the data from Rev.\n
        You should leave your phone for a few minutes.\n
        When the sync finished the notification disappears and data is saved into a csv file.\n
        You may use that file to import into Google Sheet or other platform where you want to verify and filter that data.\n
        This file sharing is done from this screen, the tickers will be also shown\n
